            <h1>
            Aegan
            </h1>
            <p>
            Aegean cats (Greek: γάτα του Αιγαίου gáta tou Aigaíou) are a naturally occurring landrace of domestic cat originating from the Cycladic Islands of Greece and western Turkey. It is considered a natural cat, developing without human interference. Development of the Aegean cat as a formal breed began in the early 1990s by breeders in the fledgling Greek cat fancy, but the variety has yet to be recognized by any major fancier and breeder organization. It is considered to be the only native Greek variety of cat.

            American Wirehair
            </h1>
            <p>
            The American Wirehair is a breed of domestic cat originating in upstate New York, which is characterized by its wiry fur and crinkly whiskers caused by a genetic mutation. As of 2017, though the breed is well-known, it is ranked as the rarest of the 41 Cat Fanciers' Association breeds.

            <h1>
            Balinese
            </h1>
            <p>
            The Balinese is a long-haired breed of domestic cat with Siamese-style point coloration and sapphire-blue eyes. The Balinese is also known as the purebred long-haired Siamese since it originated as a natural mutation of that breed and hence is essentially the same cat but with a medium-length silky coat and a distinctively plumed tail.

            As is the case with their short-haired counterparts, a genetic distinction is made between traditional or "old-style" and modern body types. In the American standard, color variants derived from the Colorpoint Shorthair are further considered a separate breed, known as the Javanese. There is no particular connection between these cats and the Indonesian islands of Bali and Java, from which they derive their names.

            Like their Siamese ancestors, Balinese are sociable, vocal, playful, inquisitive, and intelligent.

            Bengal
            </h1>
            <p>
            The Bengal cat is a breed of hybrid cat created from crossing of an Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) with domestic cats, especially the spotted Egyptian Mau. It is then usually bred with a breed that demonstrates a friendlier personality, because after breeding a domesticated cat with a wildcat, its friendly personality may not manifest in the kitten. The breed's name derives from the leopard cat's taxonomic name.

            Bengals have varying appearances. Their coats range from spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, to marbling.

            <h1>
            British Shorthair
            </h1>
            <p>
            The British Shorthair is the pedigree version of the traditional British domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face. The most familiar colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, copper-coloured eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The breed has also been bred in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and colourpoint.

            It ranks among the oldest known cat landraces. This ancient British landrace was selectively bred into one of the first pedigreed cat breeds at the end of the 19th century, and today holds full recognition status in all major cat registries. It remains the most popular pedigreed breed in its native country, as registered by the UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Half of all kittens registered with the GCCF each year are British Shorthairs, making the British the most popular pedigree cat in the UK.

            The breed's relatively calm temperament make it a frequent media star, notably as the inspiration for John Tenniel's famous illustration of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. The Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) profile reads: "When gracelessness is observed, the British Shorthair is duly embarrassed, quickly recovering with a 'Cheshire cat smile'."

            Dragon Li
            </h1>
            <p>
            The Dragon Li is a recently established Chinese breed of domestic cat (also called Chinese Li Hua or China Li Hua as a standardized breed, depending on breed registry). It was developed from a common landrace of cats in China, known as 貍花貓, Pinyin: líhuā māo, literally 'leopard cat patterned cat' (sometimes shortened to 花貓 huā māo or 貍貓 lí māo); the native cats are featured in some Chinese folklore stories. The derived standardized breed is recognized by China's Cat Aficionado Association (CAA), and was for a time by the US-based, international Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), later revoked.

            Kanaani
            </h1>
            <p>
            Kanaani cat (Hebrew: חתול כנעני) is an experimental domesticated cat breed that was bred in Germany, but originated in a cattery in Jerusalem.

            The cat breed was named after the land of Canaan, which is now recognized as the area located between the Lebanon and the Sinai Peninsula.

            Kanaanis still have wild instincts shared from wildcats, and are a fairly new domesticated cat breed. They are also called "experimental", because they are still being domesticated.

            <p>
            The Ragamuffin is a breed of domestic cat. It was once considered to be a variant of the Ragdoll cat but was established as a separate breed in 1994. Ragamuffins are notable for their friendly personalities and thick fur.
